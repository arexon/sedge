## Why use Sedge?

Sedge takes full advantage of TypeScript and its powerful type system to create
a functional, declarative API that elevates Add-On development to the next
level!

- ⚙️ **Generator Functions** for intuitive creation of files such as entities
- 💾 **Custom Components** to allow for abstracting away logic into composable
  and reusable functions
- 📚 **File Collections** which make it super easy to mass generate files or
  group a related set of files
- 📦 **Modular design** to fit into almost any existing pipelines
- 🐇 **Rapid development** experience by compiling your code into the
  `com.mojang` directory instantly
- 🪝 **A hook system** that enables you to run code only in a specific compile
  mode
- 🌍 **Build worlds** ergonomically by saving or testing them through a single
  command
- 🦺 **Typesafe** so you never have to read documentation ever again
- 🎮 **Advanced CLI** for easy management of your project
- 🔧 **Hackable** to extend or modify how Sedge works
