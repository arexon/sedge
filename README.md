## Why use Sedge?

Sedge takes full advantage of TypeScript and its powerful type system to create
a functional, declarative API that elevates Add-On development.

- ⚙️ **Game Elements** for intuitive creation of files such as entities or
  blocks
- 💾 **Custom Components** to allow for abstracting away logic into composable
  and reusable functions which can be used in Game Elements
- 📚 **File Collections** which make it super easy to mass generate files or
  group a related set of files
- 🧩 **Modular by design** to fit into almost any existing build pipelines
- 🐇 **Rapid development** experience by compiling your code into the
  `com.mojang` directory and keeping a single source of truth
- 🪝 **A hook system** that enables you to interact with the internal build
  process of Sedge
- 🦺 **Typesafe** so you never have to reference documentation ever again
- 🕹️ **Advanced CLI** to manage worlds, compiling, packaging, and repetitive
  tasks
